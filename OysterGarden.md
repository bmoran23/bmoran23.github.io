# The Oyster Garden
The pier is also an [Oyster Garden](https://www.cbf.org/how-we-save-the-bay/programs-initiatives/virginia/oyster-restoration/oyster-gardening/index.html)
An Oyster Garden is like a foster home for baby oysters called spats. Each year we get spats from the [Chesapeake Bay Foundation](https://www.cbf.org) CBF they stay in cages on the pier and grow. Every couple of weeks the cages and oysters get cleaned so water flows through the cages and the oysters can eat. At the end of the year you return the oysters and get a new batch. The CBF places the transplanted oysters onto sanctuary (non-harvest) reefs in the Bay. 

I love oysters and when I heard that a single oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water a day, I knew I wanted to help. 

When you first get the oysters the spats (the babies) are in cages on old oyster shells.

Spats look like this. This spat picture is from August.

It is important to support resturants that work with the CBF or other organizations like the [Friends of the Rappahannock](https://riverfriends.org/) to recycle oysters so spats have a place to grow.

By December the spats were little oysters.
